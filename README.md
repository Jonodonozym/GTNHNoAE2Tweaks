# GTNH No-AE2 challenge tweaks

I made this GTNH add-on to help facilitate my No-AE2 challenge run

# Features
- EOH no longer requires an ME output bus or ME hatch, and can have unlimited output hatches.
- Gorge no longer requires an me output bus
- Added input separation toggle to Industrial Press and Precise Assembler multiblocks.

Be very careful turning input separation off with the PRASS because it's a lag monster. Try to limit yourself to 1 recipe per PRASS, and restrict your input bus sizes where reasonable.

# TODO
I will only bother with these if other people want to do no-ae2 runs.
- Infinite multi-slot output hatch for EOH, and re-instating the 1-output hatch restriction
- Add recipe locking to more multiblocks to save tps
- Functionally disable AE2 and/or crafting recipes
- Make each change configurable, e.g. if you only want the input separation tweak
